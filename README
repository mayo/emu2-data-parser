Simple tag parser and data parser for the [Rainforest Automation EMU2](https://www.rainforestautomation.com/rfa-z105-2-emu-2-2/) energy meter. It expects to be fed serial data from the meter, and it triggers callbacks based on the received data.

Work in progress, I'm sure there are plenty of memory leaks. There is no autoamted testing, somewhat tested manually. It seems to work for me(tm) on a microcontroller.

I use this in conjunction with ESPhome component to feed data to Home Assistant.
